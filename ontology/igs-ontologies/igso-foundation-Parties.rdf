        <dcterms:abstract>This ontology defines the high-level concepts for party roles. The concept of a party in a role describes some entity defined specifically in terms of one or more roles it performs in situations and other relationships such as some formal contractual or transactional relationship.</dcterms:abstract>

        <skos:changeNote>The http://www.omg.org/spec/EDMC-FIBO/FND/20130801/Parties/Parties.rdf version of the ontology was was modified per the issue resolutions identified in the FIBO FND 1.0 FTF report and in https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/1.0/AboutFND-1.0/.</skos:changeNote>
        <skos:changeNote>The http://www.omg.org/spec/EDMC-FIBO/FND/20141101/Parties/Parties.rdf version of this ontology was revised as a part of the issue resolutions identified in the FIBO FND 1.1 RTF report to add a parent of hasDate to date properties.</skos:changeNote>
        <skos:changeNote>The http://www.omg.org/spec/EDMC-FIBO/FND/20160201/Parties/Parties.rdf version of this ontology was revised as a part of the FIBO 2.0 RFC to introduce disjointness axioms to aid users in understanding.</skos:changeNote>
        <skos:changeNote>The http://www.omg.org/spec/FIBO/Foundations/20130601/Roles/Parties.owl version of the ontology was revised in advance of the September 2013 New Brunswick, NJ meeting, as follows:
	(1) to use slash style URI/IRIss (also called 303 URIs, vs. hash style) as required to support server side processing 
	(2) to use version-independent IRIs for all definitions internally as opposed to version-specific IRIs
	(3) to change the file suffix from .owl to .rdf to increase usability in RDF tools
	(4) to use 4-level abbreviations and corresponding namespace prefixes for all FIBO ontologies, reflecting a family/specification/module/ontology structure
	(5) to incorporate changes to the specification metadata to support documentation at the family, specification, module, and ontology level, similar to the abbreviations.
	(6) to combine Parties, Party Roles, and Roles in a single, new, Parties module, combine Parties and Party Roles into a single ontology, and add an inverse for the hasParty property.</skos:changeNote>
        <skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Parties/Parties.rdf version of the ontology was modified to use the Commons Ontology Library (Commons) Annotation Vocabulary rather than the OMG&apos;s Specification Metadata vocabulary.</skos:changeNote>
        <skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Parties/Parties.rdf version of this ontology was extended to add the concepts of tax identifier and tax identification scheme.</skos:changeNote>
        <skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Parties/Parties.rdf version of this ontology was extended to align the properties holds and isHeldBy with the lattice to improve ownership-related reasoning.</skos:changeNote>
        <skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Parties/Parties.rdf version of this ontology was extended to rename &apos;hasPrimaryParty&apos; to &apos;hasActiveParty&apos; to be more consistent.</skos:changeNote>
        <skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Parties/Parties.rdf version of this ontology was extended to support more complex situations involving parties in various roles, loosen the restriction on party in role with respect to commencement date, and to eliminate the redundant union in the definition of independent party.</skos:changeNote>
        <skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Parties/Parties.rdf version of this ontology was modified to use the Commons Ontology Library (Commons) rather than the OMG&apos;s Languages, Countries and Codes (LCC) and to eliminate redundancies in FIBO as appropriate.</skos:changeNote>
        <skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Parties/Parties.rdf version of this ontology was revised to add a relationship directly between parties and a party identifier and rename (migrate) the hasDefinition property to isDefinedIn to clarify intent.</skos:changeNote>
        <skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Parties/Parties.rdf version of this ontology was revised to add semantics to the definition of independent party, making it a direct subclass of autonomous agent (rather than inferred only) and making person and organization direct subclasses (rather than inferred only).</skos:changeNote>
        <skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Parties/Parties.rdf version of this ontology was revised to add the two remaining property chains to complete the lattice, from independent party to thing via the situation, to simplify the class hierarchy for improved understanding, data mapping and alignment, and to add the notion of a contextual name (i.e., a name for someone, some place or something that applies for some period of time in some context).</skos:changeNote>
        <skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Parties/Parties.rdf version of this ontology was revised to address hygiene issues with respect to text formatting.</skos:changeNote>
        <skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Parties/Parties.rdf version of this ontology was revised to eliminate duplication with the concepts in LCC.</skos:changeNote>
        <skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Parties/Parties.rdf version of this ontology was revised to make hasRelatedPartyInRole symmetric and move hasMailingAddress from people to this ontology.</skos:changeNote>

        <skos:example>Examples include organization member, issuer, owner, partner in a partnership, shareholder, etc.</skos:example>
        <skos:scopeNote>The concept of a party in a role refers only to those contexts in which in natural English one would call someone a &apos;party&apos; for example being party to a contract or to a transaction; it does not cover entities as performing some role in some activity or process (the separate concept Actor covers that). A good test is whether the relative thing defined as PartyInRole can be sensibly said to have a part or play a part in something. Corresponds to the English (not data modeling) sense of the word &apos;Party&apos;.</skos:scopeNote>
