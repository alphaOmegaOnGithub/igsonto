        <dcterms:abstract>This ontology defines high-level, control-related concepts, including basic concepts for control, along with a distinction between de jure and de facto control, the former being derived with reference to terms in the LegalCapacity ontology.</dcterms:abstract>

        <skos:changeNote>The http://www.omg.org/spec/FIBO/Foundations/20130601/OwnershipAndControl/Control.owl version of the ontology was revised in advance of the September 2013 New Brunswick, NJ meeting, as follows:
	(1) to use slash style URI/IRIss (also called 303 URIs, vs. hash style) as required to support server side processing 
	(2) to use version-independent IRIs for all definitions internally as opposed to version-specific IRIs
	(3) to change the file suffix from .owl to .rdf to increase usability in RDF tools
	(4) to use 4-level abbreviations and corresponding namespace prefixes for all FIBO ontologies, reflecting a family/specification/module/ontology structure
	(5) to incorporate changes to the specification metadata to support documentation at the family, specification, module, and ontology level, similar to the abbreviations.</skos:changeNote>
        <skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/OwnershipAndControl/Control.rdf version of the ontology was modified to address hygiene issues with respect to text formatting.</skos:changeNote>
        <skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/OwnershipAndControl/Control.rdf version of the ontology was modified to eliminate references to external dictionary sites that no longer resolve.</skos:changeNote>
        <skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/OwnershipAndControl/Control.rdf version of the ontology was modified to incorporate the latest insights into how control relations should integrate with the control situation and to unwind confusion around the various properties used to represent aspects of control with respect to their domains and ranges.</skos:changeNote>
        <skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/OwnershipAndControl/Control.rdf version of the ontology was modified to integrate the concept of a situation, situational roles, and corresponding relations with the definition of control and eliminate minimum cardinality of 1 restrictions.</skos:changeNote>
        <skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/OwnershipAndControl/Control.rdf version of the ontology was modified to simplify control concepts and relations, complete the control patterns, and eliminate ambiguity in definitions.</skos:changeNote>
        <skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/OwnershipAndControl/Control.rdf version of the ontology was modified to use the Commons Ontology Library (Commons) Annotation Vocabulary rather than the OMG&apos;s Specification Metadata vocabulary.</skos:changeNote>
        <skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/OwnershipAndControl/Control.rdf version of the ontology was was modified per the issue resolutions identified in the FIBO FND 1.0 FTF report and in https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/1.0/AboutFND-1.0/.</skos:changeNote>
        <skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/OwnershipAndControl/Control.rdf version of this ontology was modified to use the Commons Ontology Library (Commons) rather than the OMG&apos;s Languages, Countries and Codes (LCC), eliminating redundancies in FIBO as appropriate.</skos:changeNote>
