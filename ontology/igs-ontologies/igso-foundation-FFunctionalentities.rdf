        <dcterms:abstract>This ontology defines the fundamental concepts for entities defined by their function, such as the relationship to the various forms which one or another functionally-defined entity may take. It also includes a number of basic types of entity defined by function, such as business and non-profit. The concepts in this ontology are intended to be extensible in other ontologies which may be dedicated to specific kinds of functionally-defined business entity or organization.</dcterms:abstract>

        <skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/BE/FunctionalEntities/FunctionalEntities.rdf version of the ontology was modified to use the Commons Ontology Library (Commons) Annotation Vocabulary rather than the OMG&apos;s Specification Metadata vocabulary.</skos:changeNote>
        <skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/BE/FunctionalEntities/FunctionalEntities.rdf version of this ontology was modified by the FIBO 2.0 revision to address missing labels and definitions on the deprecated sole proprietorship class to match those in the equivalent class.</skos:changeNote>
        <skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/BE/FunctionalEntities/FunctionalEntities.rdf version of this ontology was modified per the issue resolutions identified in the FIBO BE 1.0 FTF report.</skos:changeNote>
        <skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/BE/FunctionalEntities/FunctionalEntities.rdf version of this ontology was modified per the issue resolutions identified in the FIBO BE 1.1 RTF report. Changes include deprecation of the SoleProprietorship class and making it equivalent to the class with the same name in the Sole Proprietorships ontology. This version also introduces a new FunctionalEntity class, as the parent of FunctionalBusinessEntity in this ontology and as the parent of Government in the GovernmentEntities ontology.</skos:changeNote>
        <skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/BE/FunctionalEntities/FunctionalEntities.rdf version of this ontology was modified to add the concept of an association.</skos:changeNote>
        <skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/BE/FunctionalEntities/FunctionalEntities.rdf version of this ontology was modified to address a circular definition on association.</skos:changeNote>
        <skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/BE/FunctionalEntities/FunctionalEntities.rdf version of this ontology was modified to address text formatting hygiene issues.</skos:changeNote>
        <skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/BE/FunctionalEntities/FunctionalEntities.rdf version of this ontology was modified to eliminate deprecated elements.</skos:changeNote>
        <skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/BE/FunctionalEntities/FunctionalEntities.rdf version of this ontology was modified to eliminate duplication of concepts in LCC.</skos:changeNote>
        <skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/BE/FunctionalEntities/FunctionalEntities.rdf version of this ontology was modified to generalize certain unions where they were no longer required and eliminate an unused import.</skos:changeNote>
        <skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/BE/FunctionalEntities/FunctionalEntities.rdf version of this ontology was modified to reflect the move of some organization-specific concepts from BE to FND.</skos:changeNote>
        <skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/BE/FunctionalEntities/FunctionalEntities.rdf version of this ontology was modified to revise and extend the definition of merchant, to support merchant category codes as needed for representation of credit card transactions, merge business and functional business entity and eliminate commerce and commercial activity (which are not used anywhere in FIBO), and to clean up definitions and make them ISO 704 compliant.</skos:changeNote>
        <skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/BE/FunctionalEntities/FunctionalEntities.rdf version of this ontology was modified to use the Commons Ontology Library (Commons) rather than the OMG&apos;s Languages, Countries and Codes (LCC) and to eliminate redundancies in FIBO as appropriate.</skos:changeNote>
