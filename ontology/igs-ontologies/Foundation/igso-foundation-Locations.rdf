        <dcterms:abstract>This ontology provides a very high level definition of geographic region and geopolitical entity related concepts, including, but not limited to, countries, sub-country regions such as states and provinces, municipalities, etc., extending the Object Management Group (OMG)&apos;s Languages, Countries, and Codes (LCC) ontologies as needed in FIBO. As such, these terms are automatically mapped to the LCC controlled vocabulary representing ISO 3166 country and country subdivision codes, and may be mapped to other de facto standards such as Geonames and the CIA World Factbook. The concept of a business center, defined herein, maps directly to the FpML concept with the same name, and to the set of business centers and broader municipalities included in ISO 10383, Codes for exchanges and market identification (MIC).</dcterms:abstract>

Common population definitions for an urban area (city or town) range between 1,500 and 50,000 people, with most U.S states using a minimum between 1,500 and 5,000 inhabitants. Some jurisdictions set no such minima.</cmns-av:explanatoryNote>
        <cmns-av:usageNote>This property should be used in cases where a formal individual for the business center or municipality is not available.
