        <skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FBC/FinancialInstruments/FinancialInstruments.rdf version of the ontology was modified to use the Commons Ontology Library (Commons) Annotation Vocabulary rather than the OMG&apos;s Specification Metadata vocabulary and to add a new property, has underlier, which is needed in both securities and derivatives.</skos:changeNote>
        <skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FBC/FinancialInstruments/FinancialInstruments.rdf version of this ontology was modified to augment the definition of a commodity contract with a quantity and price as of contract execution.</skos:changeNote>
        <skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FBC/FinancialInstruments/FinancialInstruments.rdf version of this ontology was modified to use the Commons Ontology Library (Commons) rather than the OMG&apos;s Languages, Countries and Codes (LCC), eliminating redundancies in FIBO as appropriate.</skos:changeNote>
        <skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FBC/FinancialInstruments/FinancialInstruments/ version of this ontology was modified as a part of organizational hierarchy simplification, to add maturity-related properties, and to add exempt security.</skos:changeNote>

        <skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FBC/FinancialInstruments/FinancialInstruments/ version of this ontology was modified to add a property indicating the currency that an instrument is issued in, simplify the contract party hierarchy and add properties relating financial instruments to shareholders.</skos:changeNote>
        <skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FBC/FinancialInstruments/FinancialInstruments/ version of this ontology was modified to add the concept of a spot contract and clarify the definition of time to maturity, as well as add a property for days to maturity.</skos:changeNote>
        <skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FBC/FinancialInstruments/FinancialInstruments/ version of this ontology was modified to address dead links and text formatting issues uncovered by hygiene testing.</skos:changeNote>
        <skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FBC/FinancialInstruments/FinancialInstruments/ version of this ontology was modified to change the restriction on financial instrument identifier from some values to min 0, to allow for cases when an instrument identifier identifies a listing, eliminate duplication of concepts in LCC, and simplify addresses.</skos:changeNote>
        <skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FBC/FinancialInstruments/FinancialInstruments/ version of this ontology was modified to correct the label on packaged financial product.</skos:changeNote>
        <skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FBC/FinancialInstruments/FinancialInstruments/ version of this ontology was modified to eliminate deprecated content, i.e., properties related to maturity that are now in the Debt ontology and revise the definition of a securities transaction identifier to align with ISO 23897.</skos:changeNote>

        <skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FBC/FinancialInstruments/FinancialInstruments/ version of this ontology was modified to incorporate a hasMaturityDate property given that it can apply to debt instruments and preferred shares, as well as to other financial instruments, eliminated the redundant hasScheduledMaturityDate property, cleaned up circular definitions, eliminated the property &apos;mayBeTradedIn&apos;, which was only used in one place and was redundant with the concept of a ListedSecurity / Listing in SEC, added a synonym and additional explanatory note to packaged financial product, added hasNominalValue, which was a gap, and added back restrictions on debt instrument for hasMaturityDate (min 0 to account for rare instruments (e.g., consul) that have no maturity date), hasDurationToMaturity and hasTimeToMaturity.</skos:changeNote>
        <skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FBC/FinancialInstruments/FinancialInstruments/ version of this ontology was modified to make Entitlement a subclass of Security and fix spelling.</skos:changeNote>
        <skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FBC/FinancialInstruments/FinancialInstruments/ version of this ontology was modified to move properties and restrictions related to maturity to the Debt ontology, on credit agreement, and deprecate them here as well as to restructure the relationship between the two ontologies.</skos:changeNote>
        <skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FBC/FinancialInstruments/FinancialInstruments/ version of this ontology was modified to move redemption provision from debt to financial instruments, given that it is a broader concept needed for equities.</skos:changeNote>

        <skos:definition>contract terms that, grouped together, that are generally and consistently reused across many contracts, published by some organization, and capable of being incorporated into a contract by reference</skos:definition>
        <skos:example>Each exchange has a set of terms they apply to membership agreements and with respect to the instruments that may be traded on that exchange. For example, there is a set expiration date that exchanges will publish for exchange-traded options - in the US it is the Saturday following the third Friday of every month. Similarly, there are set incremental dates for strike for exchange traded options. Contract sizes are also stipulated, for example in the US these are standardized by the OPRA Convention (Options Pricing Reporting Authority).</skos:example>
