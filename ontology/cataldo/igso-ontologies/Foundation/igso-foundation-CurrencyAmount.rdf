        <dcterms:abstract>This ontology defines currency and monetary amount related concepts for use in defining other FIBO ontology elements. There are two distinct kinds of concepts that correspond to money and amounts: a concrete, actual amount of money, and the monetary measure of something denominated in some currency. These are dimensionally the same but whereas &apos;money amount&apos; is defined as an amount of money, &apos;monetary amount&apos; is an abstract monetary measure.

The definition of currency provided herein is compliant with the definitions given in ISO 4217. ISO 4217 provides universally applicable coded representations of names of currencies and funds, used internationally for financial transaction support. The ontology has been partitioned into 2 parts: (1) the essential concept system describing the standard (this module), and (2) ISO4217-1-CurrencyCodes, which contains all of the individuals specified in ISO 4217.</dcterms:abstract>

        <skos:changeNote>The FIBO FND 1.0 (https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Accounting/CurrencyAmount.rdf) version of this ontology was modified per the additions introduced in the FIBO FBC RFC and related issue resolutions identified in the FIBO FND 1.1 RTF report and https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/1.0/AboutFND-1.1/, including adding support for ISO 4217 currency codes.</skos:changeNote>
        <skos:changeNote>The FIBO FND 1.1 (https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Accounting/CurrencyAmount.rdf) version of this ontology was modified per FIBO 2.0 RFC, including the addition of a new hasMonetaryAmount property as a superproperty of others required by various FIBO domain teams and integration with LCC.</skos:changeNote>
        <skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Accounting/CurrencyAmount.rdf version of this ontology was modified to include several classes to support automated inclusion of all ISO 4217 codes published as of 2018-06-04, and to revise definitions per the eighth edition of the specification.</skos:changeNote>
        <skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Accounting/CurrencyAmount.rdf version of this ontology was modified to use the Commons Ontology Library (Commons) Annotation Vocabulary rather than the OMG&apos;s Specification Metadata vocabulary.</skos:changeNote>
        <skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Accounting/CurrencyAmount.rdf version of this ontology was modified to use the Commons Ontology Library (Commons) rather than the OMG&apos;s Languages, Countries and Codes (LCC) and to eliminate redundancies in FIBO as appropriate.</skos:changeNote>
        <skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Accounting/CurrencyAmount/ version of this ontology was modified to add a restriction to indicate the currency on percentage monetary amount, make currency a subclass of unit of measure, and deprecate the notion of monetary measure, which is more about monetary policy and was incorrectly used in a few places, and is out of scope for our current set of use cases.</skos:changeNote>
        <skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Accounting/CurrencyAmount/ version of this ontology was modified to correct the explanatory note on currency identifier.</skos:changeNote>
        <skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Accounting/CurrencyAmount/ version of this ontology was modified to eliminate deprecated elements.</skos:changeNote>
        <skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Accounting/CurrencyAmount/ version of this ontology was modified to eliminate duplication with concepts in LCC, dependencies on a couple of ontologies that were unnecessary, eliminate references to external dictionary sites that no longer resolve, clean up ambiguity in definitions, eliminate a redundant property, and add unit price.</skos:changeNote>
        <skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Accounting/CurrencyAmount/ version of this ontology was modified to eliminate hygiene errors with respect to text formatting.</skos:changeNote>
        <skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Accounting/CurrencyAmount/ version of this ontology was modified to improve definitions for notional amount and currency identifier.</skos:changeNote>
        <skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Accounting/CurrencyAmount/ version of this ontology was modified to loosen a restriction on currency to allow for more than one numeric currency code, which was necessitated by the October 2021 update to the ISO currency code definitions.</skos:changeNote>
        <skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Accounting/CurrencyAmount/ version of this ontology was modified to move the definition of precious metal and the corresponding identifier to this ontology from Products and Services to simplify imports in cases where the broader definitions for commodities are not required and deprecated isTenderIn, given that we have used the property isUsedBy for this purpose in the currency codes themselves.</skos:changeNote>
        <skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Accounting/CurrencyAmount/ version of this ontology was modified to replace a redundant concept, calculation formula with formula.</skos:changeNote>
        <skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Accounting/CurrencyAmount/ version of this ontology was modified to use the generic statistical measures and measurements now in FND.</skos:changeNote>
        <skos:editorialNote>(1) The present version of the ontology covers the English sections of the ISO 4217 standard only, and (2) UTF-8 character encodings are employed in names in the currency codes ontology to support the broadest number of tools.</skos:editorialNote>

        <rdfs:label>has notional amount</rdfs:label>
        <skos:definition>has an abstract, unchangeable value used for certain applicable calculations, expressed as some monetary amount</skos:definition>
        <skos:editorialNote>The domain for this property should be interpreted as being an abstraction which covers various forms of commitment, which may set out the existence of some notional amount of money, specified via this property. This is left unspecified for now, so that the property can also be defined directly as being a property of some contractual term which describes that commitment.</skos:editorialNote>
        <cmns-av:explanatoryNote>The notional amount (or notional principal amount or notional value) on a financial instrument is the nominal or face amount that is used to calculate payments made on that instrument. This amount generally does not change and is thus referred to as notional.
		
		For securities the nominal value is often referred to as the face or par value. This is the redemption price of the security and is normally stated on the front of that security. With respect to bonds and stocks, it is the stated value of an issued security, as opposed to its market value.
		
		When applied to a swap this is the amount used for calculating the actual value of the interest due. Also known as Notional Value when describing derivative contracts in the options, futures, and currency markets, this term is often used to value the underlying asset in a derivatives trade. It can be the total value of a position, how much value a position controls, or an agreed-upon amount in a contract.

		An example is that a firm might have a variable rate loan on $100,000 but decide to swap only $40,000. The $40,000 is the notional amount of the swap and becomes the amount on which interest is paid.</cmns-av:explanatoryNote>

        <cmns-av:explanatoryNote>The first (left-most) two characters of the ISO 4217 3-letter currency identifier relate to the currency authority that issues the currency, and is, in most cases the ISO 3166-1 alpha 2 code for the geopolitical entity whose central bank is the issuer. The third (right-most) character of the identifier (alphabetic code) is an indicator derived from the name of the major currency unit or fund. If the currency is not associated with a single geographical entity as described in ISO 3166-1, typically a specially allocated identifier (alpha-2 code) is used to describe the currency authority. This code has been allocated by the Maintenance Agency from within the user-assigned range of codes XA to XZ specified in 8.1.3 of ISO 3166-1:2013. The character following X will be a mnemonic, where possible, derived from the name of the geographical area concerned.</cmns-av:explanatoryNote>
