# Regulatory Requirement Types  IGSO-Jurisdiction


######  
# To do ! 
############### The GDPR regulatory requirements directly translates into 
	- Enterprise Content Management requirements 
	- Enterprise Recordskeeping requirements like:
 
The nature of an organisation, and the context in which it operates, dictate the type of
evidence of its activities it needs to create, the form that evidence takes, how long the
evidence should be retained and what access should be provided to that evidence over
time. These recordkeeping requirements are identified through a systematic analysis of
the organisationís business needs, legal and regulatory obligations, and broader
community expectations, as well as an assessment of the organisationís exposure to
risk if these evidential requirements are not addressed.

Recordkeeping requirements influence the type of record to be produced as evidence
of business activity and how such records are to be maintained. Some recordkeeping
requirements are stated explicitly in laws, regulations and other instruments of
authority, while others are implied by the environment in which the organisation
operates.
For example, a recordkeeping requirement may direct:
• that a record be created, or particular information be captured;
• that recorded information be retained for a specified period;
• conditions surrounding disposal of the recorded information;
• that specific content must be recorded;
• the form in which the recorded information is to be retained;
• conditions regarding access to the recorded information; and
• conditions surrounding the quality of the recorded information
