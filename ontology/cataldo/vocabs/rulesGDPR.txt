What are Ontologies?

An ontology defines the concepts and relationships used to describe and represent an area of knowledge (subject matter). It provides:

    A vocabulary
    A shared language

An ontology is defined using constructs for:

    Concepts – classes
    Relationships – properties (object and data)
    Rules – axioms and constraints
    Instances of concepts – individuals (data)
