        <skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/IND/EconomicIndicators/EconomicIndicators.rdf version of this ontology was modified to eliminate references to external dictionary sites that no longer resolve, added a synonym to fixed basket and eliminated the restriction with respect to date period, which is not the primary concern of a fixed basket, revised the name of the &apos;goods or services population&apos; to &apos;goods population&apos; to eliminate a hygiene issue and reflect the synonym of &apos;basket of goods&apos;, and merged the statistical information publisher class from economic indicator publishers into this ontology.</skos:changeNote>
        <skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/IND/EconomicIndicators/EconomicIndicators.rdf version of this ontology was modified to eliminate the restriction on economic indicator (and its subclasses) that it has an indicator value - the restriction should be on the quantity value such that the value refers to the indicator it represents, and to revise the definition of civilian non-institutional population to correctly represent civilian non-institutional person (added).</skos:changeNote>

        <skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/IND/EconomicIndicators/EconomicIndicators.rdf version of this ontology was modified to use natural person rather than legally capable person.</skos:changeNote>

An individual establishment is generally classified by having one NAICS code associated with it for statistical purposes, whereas an enterprise may be classified by multiple NAICS codes. The statistical structure is defined based on the operating structure and the accounting data produced by that entity. A given location may only need to publish revenues, whereas an operating unit (establishment) has employment statistics, etc. An establishment is defined as a producing unit at a single geographical location at which or from which economic activity is conducted and for which, at a minimum, employment data are available. In the case of a home-based business, the actual physical location would be specified as two distinct institutional units - as a household from a personal living and consumer perspective and as an establishment / operating unit due to the statistics required of the business.</cmns-av:explanatoryNote>

        <cmns-av:explanatoryNote>A household may be either (a) a one-person household, that is to say, a person who makes provision for his or her own food or other essentials for living without combining with any other person to form part of a multi-person household or (b) a multi-person household, that is to say, a group of two or more persons living together who make common provision for food or other essentials for living. The persons in the group may pool their incomes and may, to a greater or lesser extent, have a common budget; they may be related or unrelated persons or constitute a combination of persons both related and unrelated.

A household may be located in a housing unit or in a set of collective living quarters such as a boarding house, a hotel or a camp, or may comprise the administrative personnel in an institution. The household may also be homeless.</cmns-av:explanatoryNote>
        <cmns-av:explanatoryNote>From the perspective of the U.S Census Bureau, a household includes the related family members and all the unrelated people, if any, such as lodgers, foster children, wards, or employees who share the housing unit. A person living alone in a housing unit, or a group of unrelated people sharing a housing unit such as partners or roomers, is also counted as a household. The count of households excludes group quarters [such as institutional facilities]. There are two major categories of households, &apos;family&apos; and &apos;nonfamily&apos;.</cmns-av:explanatoryNote>
