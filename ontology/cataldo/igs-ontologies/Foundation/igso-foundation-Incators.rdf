        <skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/IND/Indicators/Indicators.rdf version of the ontology was modified to use the Commons Ontology Library (Commons) Annotation Vocabulary rather than the OMG&apos;s Specification Metadata vocabulary.</skos:changeNote>
        <skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/IND/Indicators/Indicators.rdf version of this ontology was modified per the FIBO 2.0 RFC, namely, to integrate concepts recently added to the FND domain including Rate, ExchangeRate, InterestRate and StructuredCollection and revise definitions of TermStructure and Volatility to better support concepts such as yield curves and analysis of market rates generally.</skos:changeNote>
        <skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/IND/Indicators/Indicators.rdf version of this ontology was modified per the issue resolutions identified in the FIBO IND 1.0 FTF 1 report.</skos:changeNote>
        <skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/IND/Indicators/Indicators.rdf version of this ontology was modified to a restriction on isValueOf to MarketRate and eliminate its dependence on PublishedFinancialInformation, and to revise the definition of market rate, daily average market rate, and end of day market rate.</skos:changeNote>
        <skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/IND/Indicators/Indicators.rdf version of this ontology was modified to add definitions for historical and implied volatility, and differentiate price volatility accordingly.</skos:changeNote>
        <skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/IND/Indicators/Indicators.rdf version of this ontology was modified to eliminate a redundant superclass declaration on MarketSpread, introduced by refactoring of FND analytics.</skos:changeNote>
        <skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/IND/Indicators/Indicators.rdf version of this ontology was modified to eliminate deprecated elements.</skos:changeNote>
        <skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/IND/Indicators/Indicators.rdf version of this ontology was modified to extend the definition of price structure to include a synonym of price history and state that it is intended to be used for any sort of analysis of historic prices.</skos:changeNote>
        <skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/IND/Indicators/Indicators.rdf version of this ontology was modified to integrate the composite date value and reflect migration of statistical measures to Analytics.</skos:changeNote>
        <skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/IND/Indicators/Indicators.rdf version of this ontology was modified to loosen the nature of a price in a price structure to include any price, not limited to a quoted price from a specific source, to allow for calculated prices to be included in the structure and to deprecate redundant terms including financial information publisher, and published financial information.</skos:changeNote>
        <skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/IND/Indicators/Indicators.rdf version of this ontology was modified to reflect the move of dated collection from arrangements to financial dates.</skos:changeNote>
        <skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/IND/Indicators/Indicators.rdf version of this ontology was modified to use the Commons Ontology Library (Commons) rather than the OMG&apos;s Languages, Countries and Codes (LCC), eliminating redundancies in FIBO as appropriate.</skos:changeNote>

        <skos:definition>structured collection of rates, such as interest rates, or bond yields with different terms to maturity, such that a yield curve may be constructed for the structure</skos:definition>
        <cmns-av:explanatoryNote>Term structure refers to a set of discrete points; elements are ordered by time. Restrictions on the rate (see above) and a point in time, paired together, and then ordered in a structured collection is how this should ultimately be modeled. Then the concept of yield curve would be a child of term structure, for calculation of net present value, for example. Term structures consist of two or more observed or projected values, typically related to debt instruments or interest rates. assessment of monetary policy conditions, and so forth.</cmns-av:explanatoryNote>
