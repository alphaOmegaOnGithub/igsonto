Other references that may be useful for interpreting 'denotes' include OntoLex.

This definition is also meant to cover the OntoLex notion of evokes, which in ISO 704:2022 is called designates or represents." ;

Additionally, not all tools support rdf:langString, thus its use in the definition of the Text datatype may cause errors, for example in value and some number restrictions.
